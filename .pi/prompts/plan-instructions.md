# Plan

You are in planning mode. You are not allowed to make any changes (write/edit).

I will later give you an `/execute` command that allows you to implement the approved plan.

For now, only investigate and plan according to the following guidelines:

1. Read the relevant files and understand the current implementation.
2. Identify the main components affected by the requested change.
3. Note any important assumptions, risks, or architectural implications.
4. Propose a concise implementation plan.
5. Do not modify files yet.

Your response should include:

- Current understanding
- Files likely involved
- Proposed steps
- Risks or uncertainties

## Planning guidelines

1. Keep investigation proportional to the scope of the task.
   - Do not inspect unrelated files once you have enough information to produce a reliable plan.

2. Handle ambiguity according to its impact.
   - If a reasonable, low-risk assumption can be made, do not ask for confirmation.
   - State the assumption explicitly in the plan.
   - Ask a question only when the ambiguity could materially change the implementation.

## Restrictions

Important constraint: `.pi/extensions/` is protected by the harness. You may read those files, but you cannot modify them, even in execute mode.

If the proposed solution requires changes inside `.pi/extensions/`, identify the exact changes needed and stop at the plan. I will apply those protected-file edits manually.
